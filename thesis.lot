\contentsline {table}{\numberline {3.1}{\ignorespaces Observations ({\it n}$_{obs}$), background estimations ($\mu _{b1,b2}$) and limits on the expected signal ($\mu _{signal}$) for the first and second science run (FRS and SSR respectively). Effective exposures are presented for $50$ GeV/c$^{2}$ WIMP mass along with relevant signal acceptance parameters. The electron recoil background expectations are calculated using Skew-Gaussian (SG) fits to the WIMP search region in $2$ keV$_{ee}$ bins and also from an equivalent exposure to a $^{137}$Cs source. The 90\% CL limits on the number of signal events were derived using the profile likelihood ratio method.}}{11}
